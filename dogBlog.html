                    <h1>What About Dogs and Some Photos of Dogs</h1>
                    <p>
                        Dogs, often hailed as humans' best friends, have been the topic of many scientific studies 
                        looking into how they might boost our well-being. In this Spotlight, we'll explain how your 
                        friendly pup can benefit your health across the board.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), an 
                        estimated 78 million dogs are owned as pets in the United States.

                    <p>
                        It is unclear when dogs were first domesticated, but a studyTrusted Source published last year 
                        claims that, at least in Europe, dogs were tamed 20,000-40,000 years ago.

                    <p>
                        It is likely that humans and dogs have shared a special bond of friendship and mutual support 
                        ever since at least the Neolithic period — but why has this bond been so long-lasting?

                    <p>
                        Of course, these cousins of the wolves have historically been great at keeping us and our 
                        dwellings safe, guarding our houses, our cattle, and our various material goods. Throughout 
                        history, humans have also trained dogs to assist them with hunting, or they have bred numerous 
                        quirky-looking species for their cuteness or elegance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, dogs are also — and might have always been — truly valued companions, famed for their 
                        loyalty and seemingly constant willingness to put a smile on their owners' faces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this Spotlight, we outline the research that shows how our dogs make us happier, more 
                        resilient when facing stress, and physically healthier, to name but a few ways in which these 
                        much-loved quadrupeds support our well-being.
